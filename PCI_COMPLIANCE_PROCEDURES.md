## Executive Summary

The StudentePlein Donation Portal maintains PCI DSS compliance through a **redirect-based payment architecture** that eliminates cardholder data from our environment. This document outlines the specific procedures, controls, and validation requirements to maintain **SAQ A** (Self-Assessment Questionnaire A) compliance level.

**Key Compliance Factors:**
- ✅ No cardholder data storage, processing, or transmission
- ✅ All payment processing handled by PCI Level 1 certified provider (Paystack)
- ✅ Secure redirect-based payment flow
- ✅ Proper webhook verification and API security

---

## 1. PCI DSS Scope and Classification

### 1.1 Compliance Level: SAQ A

**Qualification Criteria:**
- [x] Card-not-present merchant
- [x] All cardholder data functions outsourced to PCI DSS validated service providers
- [x] No electronic storage, processing, or transmission of cardholder data
- [x] No influence over how cardholder data is processed

**Annual Requirements:**
- Complete SAQ A questionnaire
- Maintain ASV (Approved Scanning Vendor) quarterly scans
- Attestation of Compliance (AOC) submission
- Policy and procedure documentation

### 1.2 In-Scope Systems

| System | Component | PCI Scope | Risk Level |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Donation Portal** | Next.js Application | In-Scope | Medium |
| **API Endpoints** | Payment initialization & verification | In-Scope | Medium |
| **Webhooks** | Paystack event processing | In-Scope | Medium |
| **Database** | Transaction metadata only | In-Scope | Low |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Hosting infrastructure | In-Scope | Low |
| **Development Environment** | Local development | Out-of-Scope | N/A |

### 1.3 Out-of-Scope Systems

- **Paystack Payment Pages**: Handled by PCI Level 1 provider
- **Card Processing**: No direct interaction with cardholder data
- **Administrative Systems**: No payment data access
- **Analytics Platforms**: Anonymized data only

## 2. Payment Flow Security Controls

### 2.1 Payment Architecture Overview

    B --> C[Create Paystack Transaction]
    C --> D[Redirect to Paystack]
    D --> E[User Enters Card Details on Paystack]

    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
    style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
```

**Critical Security Boundary:** Steps E and F occur entirely on Paystack's PCI-compliant infrastructure.

### 2.2 Payment Initialization Security (`/api/subscription/initialize`)

**Security Controls:**
```typescript
// Input Validation
const validated = yield* Schema.decodeUnknown(CreateSubscriptionRequestSchema)(body);

// Email Sanitization
const trimmedEmail = validated.email.trim();
if (!trimmedEmail || trimmedEmail.length === 0) {
  return yield* Effect.fail(new BadRequestError("Email is required"));
}

// Secure API Communication
const result = yield* initializeTransaction({
  email: trimmedEmail,
  amount: plan.amount * 100,
  callback_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/donation/callback`,
  metadata: { /* Non-sensitive metadata only */ }
});
```

**Compliance Verification:**
- [ ] No cardholder data collected or processed
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Secure communication with Paystack API
- [ ] Error handling without sensitive data exposure

### 2.3 Transaction Verification Security (`/api/subscription/verify`)

**Data Filtering Implementation:**
```typescript
function createSafeTransactionResponse(transaction: Record<string, unknown>) {
  // Only return non-sensitive transaction data
  return {
    amount: transaction.amount,
    currency: transaction.currency,
    reference: transaction.reference,
    plan: transaction.plan,
    customer: { email: customer?.email },
    metadata: { plan_interval: metadata?.plan_interval }
  }
}
```

**Compliance Verification:**
- [ ] Sensitive data filtered from API responses
- [ ] Transaction verification server-side only
- [ ] No cardholder data in verification process
- [ ] Proper error handling for failed verifications

### 2.4 Webhook Security (`/api/webhooks/paystack`)

**HMAC Signature Verification:**
```typescript
function verifyWebhookSignature(payload: string, signature: string): boolean {
  const secret = process.env.NEXT_PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY!
  const hash = crypto.createHmac('sha512', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')
  return hash === signature
}
```

**Security Controls:**
- [ ] HMAC SHA-512 signature verification implemented
- [ ] Webhook payload validation with schemas
- [ ] No sensitive data logging in webhook handlers
- [ ] Proper error handling for invalid webhooks
